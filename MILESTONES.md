Idea Description: 
- Idea: A tool that creates UML/Class diagrams to show Class Coupling of a Java project
- Visualization: We can use a webpage to showcase diagrams or solely create UML/Class diagrams for highlighting classes that are coupled with corresponding colours.
- Input data: Project files and/or folder(s) containing Java files or other folders, which contain java files or are possibly empty
- How would we show coupling? One way is to measure how many methods of one class calls another classâ€™ methods.
- What problem does the tool try to address? This tool would be helpful if the programmer has to deal with hundreds of files, so it'll make it easier to get the bigger picture and understand the flow. It is also useful if the programmer needs to focus on a certain area of a large project.

TA Feedback: 
- TA said our idea seemed good and needed to double-check with Profressor Alex.


Follow Up Tasks & Features: 
- Figure out how to show coupling and create the diagrams in an efficient/organized manner
- We can take into account of how the diagrams will be colour-coded. For example, if the programmer wants to only look at the coupling of a specific class, this class and its coupled classes will be highlighted in one colour while the rest will greyed out/less visible. That way, the area that the programmer is currently focusing on stands out from the rest.
- Meet up next week to discuss roles and more details on our plans
